            Welcome to the Mod Organizer 2 installer!

            This installer only allows Mod Organizer 2 to manage a single game.
            Install one instance of Mod Organizer 2 for each game you want to manage.
            It is recommended to configure a cache path in "Lutris > Preferences > Lutris Preferences" to avoid re-downloading files.

            Which game would you like to manage with this installation?

        It is recommended to rename this instance so it's easier to tell which game it manages.
        You can do so by right clicking it on Lutris > Configure > Game Info.

        A few things to keep in mind before using Mod Organizer 2:

        * Mod Organizer 2 cannot open a browser. In order to login to Nexus, you must manually
          add the API key you generated at https://www.nexusmods.com/users/myaccount?tab=api

        * The script extender for the game you selected is already installed and ready to use

        * If you need to run Proc Patchers, a Java binary is available at C:\java\bin\java.exe
